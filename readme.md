# MSX HTML5 Presentation

[Working Demo] (http://danielscarpim.com.br/ciclo/)

This is an interactive presentation showing simple HTML5 animations. It was used by the sales team to show potential customers the possibilies with javascript animation without using flash.

This was developed entirely with HTML/CSS and SVG. I used css transforms to create an isometric view and place svg graphics over it.

Each 'box' is clickable and displays text using TweenMax.

## Development Tools
